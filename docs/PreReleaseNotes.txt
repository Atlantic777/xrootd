   * Recognize object deletion in the error handling path.
   * Add missing return statement to avoid SEGV during write error recovery
     under certain circumstances. Fixes bug 99002.
   * Add mutex serialization so as not to use only fcntl() locking
     as a synchronization primitive across threads. It doesn't work
     in Linux.
