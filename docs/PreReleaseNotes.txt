Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**

+ **Major bug fixes**
  * [Proxy] Protect forwarding proxy server from slow connections. This should
    fix most, if not all, SEGV's that the server encountered under heavy load.
  * [Server] Fixes #248 Prevent infinite loop when shift arg is negative.
  * [Server] Complain when passed I/O length is negative.
  * [Server] Avoid execution stall during node logout when the thread limit
    has been reached.
  * [Server] Make sure to capture return code for stat() to prevent random
    results.
  * [XrdCl] Make sure to get filestate lock during timeout processing to
    avoid MT intereference and possible random results.
  * [XrdClient] Restore commented out abort() when an attemp is made to index a
    vector outside of its current bounds (avoids random results).
  * [Server/Proxy] Delay deleting a file object if the close was not successful.
    This avoids deleting objects that may have pending activity resulting in an
    eventual SEGV. This is a bypass fix to another problem.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
  * [Server] Fixes #234 Properly register all components in a mkpath request.
  * Correctly handle copying into a non-existent directory when automatic
    path creation is enabled.
  * [XrdCl] xrdfs correctly handles quotations (fixes the problem with ALICE token)

+ **Miscellaneous**
  * Fixes #245 Provide compatability when cmake version is > 3.0.
  * Use atomics to manipulate unlocked variable pollNum.
