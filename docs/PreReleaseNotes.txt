Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Allow clients to easily load checksum objects via XrdCksLoader object.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Recognize object deletion in the error handling path.
   * Add missing return statement to avoid SEGV during write error recovery
     under certain circumstances. Fixes bug 99002.
   * Add mutex serialization so as not to use only fcntl() locking
     as a synchronization primitive across threads. It doesn't work
     in Linux.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Do not use AtomicDTZ and AtomicISM so as to keep LinkCount and
     LinkCountMax updates truly atomic. The mentioned atomic macros
     should be removed at the next release boundary as this will
     change a public user interface.
   * Properly recognize a loaded checksum as a native checksum.

+ **Miscellaneous**
